# AI_Paint

This is an openCV project, where I have used my camera as canvas and painted on it.
To execute this project, basic requirements you need are:
if you're using pycharm
1. install openCV
2.  mediapipe

Once you have these requirements, all you need is the input files and the code to start drawing on your screen

To do so, use HandTracing.py and Ai_painter.py. 
Run AI_painter .py.
And you'll be able to execute.

Make sure you have the exact dimensions of your camera.
And change the dimensions of the screen accordingly.

for my camera the dimensions are 480 x 640 (height, width)
also make sure to give same dimension to the img_canvas as  your img. (img, and img_canvas are the variable that store your videcapture and the canvas you can draw on)

The code is very simple to understand

I have done this course on Murtaza's workshop, you can find his channel on YouTube.

Although my code has some differenc from his.

There are other ways you can do this project, by creating masks, and other deep learning algorithms.
