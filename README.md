# AI_Paint

This is an openCV project, where I have used my camera as canvas and painted on it.
To execute this project, basic requirements you need are:
if you're using pycharm
1. install openCV
2.  mediapipe

Once you have these requirements, all you need i th input files and the code to start drawing on your screen

Make sure you have the exact dimensions of your camera.

for my camera the dimensions are 480 x 640 (height, width)
also make sure to give same dimension to the img_canvas as  your img. (img, and img_canvas are the variable that store your videcapture and the canvas you can draw on)

The code is very simple to understand

I have done this course on Murtaza's workshop, you can find his channel on YouTube.

Although my code has some differenc from his.

There are other ways you can do this project, by creating masks, and other deep learning algorithms.
